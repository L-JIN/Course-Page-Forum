# Frontend Project

The frontend project consists of three apps， `admin-app`, `course-app` & `proans-app`.
They are both generated by vue-cli 4.x.

## App Structure

Currently, what should we concern about is the `src` & `tests` folder.

The `src` containes router, vuex, components, views and the `App.vue`.
Generally, we just write some components and pull them together to make a view.

The `tests` are used to write some unit test files to check if our code is right or not.

## Collaboration

Every one is assigned some components to finish. **You'd better not change the component belongs to others**.
If a component can be divided into some small components, you should create a folder named `<TheComponentName>` using **Upper Camel Case**, and put the small components into the folder you have created.

## Docker

We can easily development & deployment our app with docker. Here is a shell batch `dockerrun.sh` that simplify our work. To start a docker container, just run the flowing commands:
```shell
chmod u+x dockerrun.sh
dockerrun course-app
```
Now that we can visit `http://localhost:${port}` to do other work.
> Different app has different port assigned, see detail in file `dockerrun.sh`.

## Bugs

when you run `yarn` to init the apps, you will probably get following message:

```shell
⠋  Running completion hooks...error: Unexpected use of file extension "js" for "./plugins/element.js" (import/extensions) at src/main.js:5:8:
  3 | import router from './router';
  4 | import store from './store';
> 5 | import './plugins/element.js';
    |        ^
  6 | 
  7 | Vue.config.productionTip = false;
  8 | 
```

Changing line 5 to `import './plugins/element'` will help you out.
